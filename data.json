    "task": "\nText: Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process employed by photoautotrophic organisms—primarily green plants, algae, and certain groups of bacteria like cyanobacteria—to transform electromagnetic radiation from the sun into stable chemical energy. This energy is not used immediately but is instead stored within the covalent bonds of carbohydrate molecules, most notably glucose and other complex sugars. These organic compounds are synthesized through a series of complex metabolic pathways involving the reduction of carbon dioxide and the oxidation of water, ultimately providing the primary fuel source for the vast majority of life on Earth.\n\nThe mechanism occurs within specialized organelles known as chloroplasts (in eukaryotic plants), where chlorophyll pigments capture specific wavelengths of light to drive the synthesis. The term itself is derived from the Greek roots phōs (meaning \"light\") and sunthesis (meaning \"putting together\" or \"composition\"). This etymology highlights the physical nature of the process: using radiant energy as the \"glue\" to assemble simple inorganic molecules into the complex organic structures that sustain the biosphere.\n\nQuestion: Based on the etymology provided, what does the word 'photosynthesis' literally mean?\n",
